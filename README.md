# School_District_Analysis

### Background
After submitting our resport on the school district analysis, the school board found evidence of grade tampering in Thomas High School 9th grade. In this analysis we remove the 9th grade test results, calculate the results, and report our findings.

### Results
In the analysis we found that: 
- The average math scores and the number of total students changed in the school district summary

- As seen above, the overall perforamce of Thomas High School is only reduced by 0.31% and still remains the second best high school in the district

- The replacement of the 9th grade only affects the grade itself as all other grades stay the same

### Summary
Although there were changes made in the report, did not differ largely since the grades of the 9th graders in Thomas High School previously scored relatively close to both the mean and the median of the 10th - 12th graders. In turn, by removing their scores and remaking the analysis, we made little change.
